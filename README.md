🚗 KNIME Workflow – Car Dataset Cleaning & Preprocessing

This project showcases a data cleaning and preprocessing workflow built using the KNIME Analytics Platform.
The workflow processes a Car Sales / Car Specifications dataset by transforming raw, inconsistent data into clean, structured, and analysis-ready output.

⭐ Project Overview

Car datasets often contain missing values, inconsistent formats, mixed data types, noisy records, and unstructured text.
This KNIME workflow automates the entire cleaning pipeline—ensuring high-quality data for further analysis, reporting, or machine learning.

🔧 Key Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps

✔ Importing Raw Data using CSV Reader
✔ Handling Missing Values – Replace, remove
✔ Removing Duplicates & Noise – Duplicate Row Filter
✔ Data Type Conversion – String → Number, Date parsing
✔ Extracting Information –  Year, Mileage
✔ Standardizing Columns – Renaming, formatting units, text cleanup
✔ Filtering Rows – Keeping only valid car records
✔ String Manipulation – Replace patterns, split columns

🎯 Objectives of the Workflow

Prepare raw car dataset into clean, structured format

Ensure consistency across all numerical and text fields

Create new derived features needed for analytics

Make dataset compatible for ML, reporting, or Tableau dashboards
